## Protoboard
First, I soldered together a prototype on a piece of protoboard, based on my initial schematic. You can see these efforts below:

This wasn't very attractive, and it didn't hang very well on the tree, so I sought out to design a custom PCB. This was my first PCB design, so I learned a lot along the way. I decided to use KiCad, since it is FOSS and very beginner friendly. I watched and followed along with Digi-Key's YouTube tutorial on KiCad.
